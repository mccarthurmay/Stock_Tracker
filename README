Hello, this is a WIP.

main.py - Recommended, newest working version
tk_test.py - Beta 


Requirements:
yfinance, pandas, matplotlib, numpy, selenium, pyinstaller, tk




*must begin all databases containing tickers with "t_", "tickers_", or "ticker_" to be properly updated
*must begin all portfolios with "p_" or "portfolio_" to be properly updated



Todo:
1. absolute low project 
    - find how much holders fluctuate 
    - use 10 rsi, 20 rsi, and 30 rsi as buy signals
    - collect all necessary information at purchase date
        - date, volume, rsi, moving average (maybe a ratio)
    - gives information on how to set limits
2. winrate project
    - find signals on why DDOG and ADBE kept rising above 70 rsi


Bugs:
1. main.py two windows when clicking "load"
2. shortrate window not displaying correctly


Notes:
1. winrate project
    - shows that 'most' stocks do not gain any more once above 70 rsi
    - bought stocks showing 'bull' and 'MA Converging: False' or 'bear' and 'MA Converging: True' are very promising to be gainers
2. shortrate project
    - still waiting on rsi values to go under
