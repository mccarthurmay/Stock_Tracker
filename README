Hello, this is a WIP.

main.py - Recommended, newest working version
tk_test.py - Beta 


Requirements:
yfinance, pandas, matplotlib, numpy, selenium, pyinstaller, tk




*must begin all databases containing tickers with "t_", "tickers_", or "ticker_" to be properly updated
*must begin all portfolios with "p_" or "portfolio_" to be properly updated



Todo:
1. absolute low project 
    - find how much holders fluctuate 
    - use 10 rsi, 15 rsi, 20 rsi, and 30 rsi as buy signals
    - collect all necessary information at purchase date
        - date, volume, rsi, moving average (maybe a ratio)
    - gives information on how to set limits
2. winrate project
    - find signals on why DDOG and ADBE kept rising above 70 rsi

4. ML that reads minute by minute data to predict the next half an hour                                                                                            

5. Probability to gain in month? (test.py, p_test2.pk)


Done:
3. rework portfolio system
    - buy price is being overwritten
    - (7/11 prices on test)
    - show gain  

Bugs:
1. main.py two windows when clicking "load"
2. shortrate window not displaying correctly


Notes:
1. winrate project
    - shows that 'most' stocks do not gain any more once above 70 rsi
    - bought stocks showing 'bull' and 'MA Converging: False' or 'bear' and 'MA Converging: True' are very promising to be gainers
    - absolute minimum may 'peak' at under 20 rsi
2. shortrate project
    - still waiting on rsi values to go under
