day 1:
.5 % return
smp steady


day 2: 
-1.6 % return

notes:
smp drop, negative tech news
double MA does not guarantee increase. Need more analysis.


day 3:
-.5% return

edit:
increase analysis date by 1 year
removed short-term moving average constraint, decreased sensitivity of long-term moving average (harder to achieve)
switched to sort by winrate
buying by sectors
reduce to 10 positions

notes:
highly variable; goes up and down real bad
may be beneficial to buy based on rsi70 again... next week

day 4:
-.8%

edit:
add short-term constraint back in
return to 10 positions


day 5:


edit:
short term input period MA is set to 1d
move back to RSI selling
change data analysis to read by 20 minutes to get more data, maxed out at 10,000
only buy on RSI < 45 + MAL = Bear, True and MAS = Bull, False

notes:
Try a bear converge approach; look into making "approach" stronger to prevent a 180 
Mark when a volume is more significant that usual and buy


BIG DEVELOPMENT!!!!!!
Need to find way to predict if it will continue in "bull bull" or will drop from "bull f to bear f", however converge rate may change this. 

Notes for development:

Only worked on 65-70 (never reset count for rest)
Main lookats: Bull F Bull F and Bull F Bear (Bear F and Bear F is hard to predict)
      - did not look at MA_L + MA_S combos
        - eg. MAL Bull F Bull F + MAS Bull F Bull 
        - MAL Bull F Bull F + MAS Bear F Bear F 
      - only looked at converge rate at 30 consecutive, meaning it was hard to hit this statistic\

!!! Found that BEAR T BULL F may be the best combination. More work to be done, only analyzed AAPL since data is slow. Also recorded by hand, so may have missed something.
