Lucid (LCID)
Rivian (RIVN)

Key Trading Rules:

Avoid first 30 minutes of any move
Best trading window: 11am - 2pm EST
Use bigger stocks with good liquidity
Wait for clear consolidation patterns
Set tight stops
Look for oversold conditions in related stocks - RSI

The safest play we identified: Trading Albemarle (ALB) after waiting for consolidation, as it offers:

Good liquidity
Clear technical levels
Often overreacts (creating reversal opportunities)
Options available for risk management
