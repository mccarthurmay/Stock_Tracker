Let me explain the legal implementations of these strategies:

Stop Loss Hunting (Legal Methods):
1. Volume Profile Analysis
- Study historical volume at price levels
- Identify areas where stops commonly cluster
- Trade based on probable support/resistance breaks
- No artificial price manipulation needed

2. Technical Level Trading
- Trading at key technical levels where stops naturally accumulate
- Using legitimate order flow to trigger price movements
- Taking advantage of natural market mechanics
- Example: Trading breakouts of major support/resistance levels

3. Price Action Trading
- Reading genuine market weakness/strength
- Trading when price naturally approaches stop areas
- Participating in, but not causing, market moves
- Following institutional order flow

Order Detection (Legal Approaches):
1. Tape Reading
- Analyzing public market data
- Looking for unusual volume patterns
- Studying public order flow
- Identifying legitimate institutional activity

2. Statistical Analysis
- Analyzing historical trading patterns
- Using public data to predict large orders
- Studying seasonal patterns
- Looking at public institutional filing data

3. Market Microstructure Analysis
- Studying changes in bid-ask spreads
- Analyzing publicly available depth of book
- Monitoring trade lot sizes
- Observing changes in market maker behavior

Would you like me to elaborate on how to implement any of these legal strategies in your trading system, particularly given your interest in IEX data?
